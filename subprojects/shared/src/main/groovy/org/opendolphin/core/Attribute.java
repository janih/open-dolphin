 * A presentation model contains a list of Attribute objects.

 * Each Attribute stores a value and a base (or original) value.  An Attribute also maintains a dirty flag, which is
 * true whenever the current value and the base (original) value are different.
 * <p/>
 * In addition, a qualifier string may be specified for an attribute; a qualifier has application-specific
