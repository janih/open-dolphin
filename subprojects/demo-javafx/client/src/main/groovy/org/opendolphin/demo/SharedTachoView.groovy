/**
 * This demo shows how to use the publish-subscribe pattern with the help of the Dolphin
 * event bus. Start multiple instances of it.
 * You can change the speed with the slider in any started instance.
 * Observe how changing the speed updates all views quasi-instantly.
 * The slider is an input control and a view of the current speed at the same time.
 * This may lead to a conflict when the speed is concurrently set in two instance to different values.
 * The latest change will win and the read-only gauge will always show the winning value.
